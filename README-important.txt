-------------------
Based on data in file Placement_Data_Full_Class.csv

1) changed_data.csv [used by salary model] i.e model2.py and salary_model.pkl

2) updated_data.csv [used by placement model] i.e model.py and placement_model.pkl

MAIN.py for execution of terminal interface to provide input and utilise both models.
